# VRP Admin Menu

Hello everyone, I have been working on this project for a while now and are very happy to make it public now. If you have any bugs or issue feel free to dm me on discord AL#4610

Features:
* Easiest Admin Menu to use within the vRP framework
* Everything you need for an admin menu
* Uses vRP groups to justify use of the menu
* Easily configurable to your liking (can enable or disable any button.)
* Admins can't ban admins. (this is configurable)

Notes:
* This is only limited to the vRP framework, feel free to edit it to your liking but the default one that comes within the [GitHub](https://github.com/arthur-rl/vrp_admin) is vRP.
* To use this menu you must have the permission set in cfg/config.lua which by default is "admin.menu".

How to install:
1. Ensure you have the RageUI resource started before the menu.
2. Download [RageUI](https://github.com/iTexZoz/RageUI).
3. Download the repo of the menu [here](https://github.com/arthur-rl/vrp_admin).
4. Copy the contents into a folder called **vrp_admin** in your resources folder
5. Copy the contents of RageUI into a folder called **_RageUI_** in your resources folder
6. Start RageUI before vrp_admin,
7. Start your server and have fun!
